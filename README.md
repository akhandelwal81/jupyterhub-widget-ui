# jupyterhub-widget-ui
Build a Jupyter Hub based UI using widgets
ipywidgets, also known as jupyter-widgets or simply widgets, are interactive HTML widgets for Jupyter notebooks and the IPython kernel. Notebooks come alive when interactive widgets are used. Users gain control of their data and can visualize changes in the data.

Besides the widgets already provided with the library, the framework can be extended with the development of custom widget libraries.

Cookiecutter template for custom widget development
A template project for building custom widgets is available as a cookiecutter. This cookiecutter project helps custom widget authors get started with the packaging and the distribution of their custom Jupyter interactive widgets. The cookiecutter produces a project for a Jupyter interactive widget library following the current best practices for using interactive widgets.

## Install
 With pip:

```
